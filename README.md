#     Corne ZMK Repository
My kbrd configuration on zmk



## Instructions

1. Use [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) to remap easier. 


**If you already have a ZMK config repository, [you can add this one as a module instead of forking](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules#building-with-modules).**

## Mouse Support

:warning: This repository defaults to an EXPERIMENTAL mouse movement branch which is slated for eventual merge into ZMK, but is not guaranteed to be stable. For more information, see [beta testing](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules#beta-testing) and [PR #2477](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2477).

If desired, edit your `config/west.yml` to switch back to `zmkfirmware`'s `main` branch:

```diff
diff --git a/config/west.yml b/config/west.yml
